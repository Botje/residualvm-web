<h3><a name="AEN6" id="AEN6"></a>1. Introduction</h3>
<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN9" id="AEN9"></a><b>1.1.</b> Why is it called
Residual - what does this name mean?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>The <a href="http://www.scummvm.org" target="_top">ScummVM</a>
program can run LucasArts 2D SCUMM adventures (among others).
Residual is named such as it aims to do the same for the residual
(remaining) games. It is also a word pun, as the engine used in
these LUA-based adventure is called GrimE (as opposed to SCUMM).
Grime is a type of residue.</p>

<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN15" id="AEN15"></a><b>1.2.</b> What is GrimE ?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>GrimE (Grim Engine) is an adventure game engine, created by Bret
Mogilefsky at LucasArts using scripting language Lua. It was first
used for Grim Fandango.</p>
</div>

<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN20" id="AEN20"></a><b>1.3.</b> Is Residual free?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Residual is released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_top">GPL (General
Public License)</a>, so it's more than free. Residual source code
is freely available and you can do whatever you want with it. If
you make modifications to it and redistribute your work you MUST
make the source available. However, the Residual team would be
pleased if you choose to send them your modifications, so they can
be merged into the main tree.</p>

<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN26" id="AEN26"></a><b>1.4.</b> On what platform does
Residual run?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Residual should be able to be compiled on any SDL platform, with
modifications.</p>
<p>Currently tested platforms include Win32 (Windows
95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP), Linux i386 and PPC, Mac OS X, AmigaOS 4.</p>

<div class="question">

</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>For most games you do not need to run the installer. Simply copy
<a href="http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/residual/index.php?title=Datafiles" target="_top">the files listed here</a> from your CD to your hard
drive, then read instructions from <a href="http://residual.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/residual/residual/trunk/README?view=markup" target="_top">README</a>.</p>

<p>Yes. You can either start your game using the -f command line
parameter, setting the game to Full Screen in the game options
configuration file.</p>

<h3><a name="AEN55" id="AEN55"></a>5. Troubleshooting</h3>
<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN58" id="AEN58"></a><b>5.1.</b> My game crashes at
some point.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Check the <a href="http://residual.sourceforge.net/compatibility.php" target="_top">Compatibility List</a> to see if your game has any known
issues. For now please don't report bugs, the Grim engine is in
still alpha state.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN64" id="AEN64"></a><b>5.2.</b> Residual crashes, but
the console window disappears too quickly to see the error
message.</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>On Windows, to make it visible, you should run Residual from the
command line. To open a command prompt, open the Start Menu and
select the 'Run' option. Under Windows NT/2000/XP, type 'cmd.exe'
(no quotes) in the dialog box that shows up; under Windows
95/98/Me, type 'command.com' instead. If necessary, change to the
proper drive first by typing 'D:' (where 'D' is the drive Residual
is located). Change to Residual's directory by typing 'cd
\your\path\to\residual' (substituting the appropriate path) and
then type 'residual'.</p>
<p>On MacOS X, you can find the error messages by starting
Console.app (in Utilities within the Applications folder). If you
prefer, you can also run Residual from the terminal. To do this,
start Terminal.app (also in the Utilities folder), then
drag&amp;drop the Resdual.app application onto the Terminal window,
remove the space at the end of the line and add
'Contents/MacOS/residual' (without the quotes). The line should
look like this: '/Path/to/Residual.app/Contents/MacOS/residual'.
Then press return to start Residual.</p>

<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN70" id="AEN70"></a><b>5.3.</b> I get "WARNING:
Unable to open configuration file C:\windows\residual.ini!"</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Make sure you have enough permissions to write in c:\windows
directory. Also note that this warning the first time you run
Residual, since the file does not exist yet then.</p>
</div>

<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN75" id="AEN75"></a><b>5.4.</b> I get "Failed to save

</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>Check savepath in residual config file. That should point to
writable directory.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN80" id="AEN80"></a><b>5.5.</b> Residual starts, but
all I get is a transparent window!</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>This problem has been reported to happen under Windows in some
cases. Check that you have the latest drivers for your graphics
card. If that does not help, try setting the <code class="envar">SDL_VIDEODRIVER</code> environment variable to "windib" and
try again.</p>
<p>Apparently other applications have had the same problem, because
the release notes for SDL 1.2.10 (May 17, 2006) contained the
following note:</p>
<a name="AEN86" id="AEN86"></a>
<blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
<p>The "windib" video driver is the default now, to prevent
problems with certain laptops, 64-bit Windows, and Windows Vista.
The DirectX driver is still available, and can be selected by
setting the environment variable <code class="envar">SDL_VIDEODRIVER</code> to "directx".</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN90" id="AEN90"></a><b>5.6.</b> Residual runs, but

</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>This problem has been reported to happen under Windows in some
cases. Check that you have the latest drivers for your sound card.
If that does not help, try setting the <code class="envar">SDL_AUDIODRIVER</code> environment variable to "waveout"
and try again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN96" id="AEN96"></a><b>5.7.</b> How do I set an
environment variable?</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>That depends on what operating system and/or command shell you
are using. Under Windows, you could try creating a file called
<b class="command">residual.bat</b> in the same folder as <b class="command">residual.exe</b>. Open this file in your favorite text
editor and put something like this in it:</p>
<a name="AEN102" id="AEN102"></a>
<blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
<pre class="programlisting">
@echo off
set SDL_VIDEODRIVER=windib
set SDL_AUDIODRIVER=waveout
residual.exe %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
</pre></blockquote>
<p>You should now be able to run Residual by double-clicking on
this batch file, instead of the Residual executable.</p>
<p>On more recent versions of Windows, you can also set an
environment variable permanently, and for all applications, through
the control panel.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="qandaentry">
<div class="question">
<p><a name="AEN107" id="AEN107"></a><b>5.8.</b> Residual starts
somewhere in the middle of my two Xinerama monitors in fullscreen
mode. Help!</p>
</div>
<div class="answer">
<p>In fact, this is SDL problem. SDL does by default has xinerama
support enabled. Set the <code class="envar">SDL_VIDEO_FULLSCREEN_HEAD</code> environment variable to
"1" to start Residual (and other SDL applications) in fullscreen on
only one monitor. If this does not work make sure your SDL library
does have Xinerama support compiled in.</p>
