      <question>Why is it called Residual - what does this name mean?</question>
      <answer>
		<simpara>
		The <ulink url="http://www.scummvm.org">ScummVM</ulink> program can run
		LucasArts 2D SCUMM adventures (among others).
		Residual is named such as it aims to do the same for the residual (remaining) 
		games. It is also a word pun, as the engine used in these LUA-based adventure
		is called GrimE (as opposed to SCUMM). Grime is a type of residue.

      <question>Residual crashes, but the console window disappears too quickly to see the error message.</question>
      <answer>
		<simpara>
		On Windows, to make it visible, you should run Residual from the command line. To open a 
		command prompt, open the Start Menu and select the 'Run' option. Under 
		Windows NT/2000/XP, type 'cmd.exe' (no quotes) in the dialog box that 
		shows up; under Windows 95/98/Me, type 'command.com' instead. If 
		necessary, change to the proper drive first by typing 'D:' (where 'D' is 
		the drive Residual is located). Change to Residual's directory by typing 
		'cd \your\path\to\residual' (substituting the appropriate path) and then 
		type 'residual'.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		On MacOS X, you can find the error messages by starting Console.app
		(in Utilities within the Applications folder). If you prefer, you can
		also run Residual from the terminal. To do this, start Terminal.app
		(also in the Utilities folder), then drag&amp;drop the Resdual.app
		application onto the Terminal window, remove the space at the end of
		the line and add 'Contents/MacOS/residual' (without the quotes). The
		line should look like this: '/Path/to/Residual.app/Contents/MacOS/residual'.
		Then press return to start Residual.

      <question>I get "WARNING: Unable to open configuration file C:\windows\residual.ini!"</question>
      <answer>
		<simpara>
		Make sure you have enough permissions to write in c:\windows directory. Also note that this warning the
		first time you run Residual, since the file does not exist yet then.

      <question>Residual starts, but all I get is a transparent window!</question>
      <answer>
		<simpara>
		This problem has been reported to happen under Windows in some cases. Check
		that you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. If that does not
		help, try setting the <envar>SDL_VIDEODRIVER</envar> environment variable to
		"windib" and try again.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		Apparently other applications have had the same problem, because the release
		notes for SDL 1.2.10 (May 17, 2006) contained the following note:
		</simpara>
		<blockquote>
		<simpara>
		The "windib" video driver is the default now, to prevent problems with
		certain laptops, 64-bit Windows, and Windows Vista. The DirectX driver
		is still available, and can be selected by setting the environment
		variable <envar>SDL_VIDEODRIVER</envar> to "directx".

      <question>Residual runs, but sound is stuttering and/or garbled!</question>
      <answer>
		<simpara>
		This problem has been reported to happen under Windows in some cases. Check
		that you have the latest drivers for your sound card. If that does not help,
		try setting the <envar>SDL_AUDIODRIVER</envar> environment variable to "waveout"
		and try again.

      <question>How do I set an environment variable?</question>
      <answer>
		<simpara>
		That depends on what operating system and/or command shell you are using.
		Under Windows, you could try creating a file called
		<command moreinfo="none">residual.bat</command> in the same folder as
		<command moreinfo="none">residual.exe</command>. Open this file in your favorite text
		editor and put something like this in it:
		</simpara>
		<blockquote>
		<programlisting format="linespecific">@echo off
set SDL_VIDEODRIVER=windib
set SDL_AUDIODRIVER=waveout
residual.exe %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9</programlisting>
		</blockquote>
		<simpara>
		You should now be able to run Residual by double-clicking on this batch file,
		instead of the Residual executable.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		On more recent versions of Windows, you can also set an environment variable
		permanently, and for all applications, through the control panel.

      <question>Residual starts somewhere in the middle of my two Xinerama monitors in fullscreen mode. Help!</question>
      <answer>
		<simpara>
		In fact, this is SDL problem. SDL does by default has xinerama support
		enabled. Set the <envar>SDL_VIDEO_FULLSCREEN_HEAD</envar>
		environment variable to "1" to start Residual (and other SDL applications) in
		fullscreen on only one monitor. If this does not work make sure your SDL
		library does have Xinerama support compiled in.
