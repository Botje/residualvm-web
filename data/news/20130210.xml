					Some time has passed since doomsday, and we're still around to see the aftermath,
					the time since then has not been wasted however. Today we release ResidualVM 0.1.1
					which is a service-release bringing you roughly 40 gameplay-fixes, varying from very
					minor fixes to quite visible bugs, 14 of these fixes were also in the original
					game as it was released back in 1998.
				</p>
				<p>
					New to this release is that ResidualVM will verify your game files upon first launch,
					this should help you be sure that your game data hasn't been corrupted by the
					teeth of time. And help us narrow down any issues you might have even further.
					For a list of what else has been fixed, see the <a href ="https://github.com/residualvm/residualvm/blob/branch-0-1/NEWS">
					NEWS-file</a>.

				<p>
					So, head on over to our <a href="http://residualvm.org/downloads/">downloads-page</a> and grab
					a fresh copy of ResidualVM 0.1.1 to enjoy the best possible Grim Fandango experience we can
					offer to date.
